## 🚀 Skills Showcase

This repo now demonstrates a compact “AI pair programmer” playbook:

- **Code reading:** quickly inspects project structure and key files.
- **Task execution:** applies focused changes with clear intent.
- **Validation:** runs checks and reports exact commands + outcomes.
- **Version-control hygiene:** commits cleanly with meaningful messages.
- **Delivery workflow:** prepares pull-request-ready summaries.

## Example Workflow

1. Inspect repository context.
2. Implement targeted improvements.
3. Run verification commands.
4. Commit with a concise, descriptive message.
5. Draft a PR title/body for review.

## Why this matters

A reliable coding assistant is not just about generating code—it’s about
making changes that are understandable, testable, and easy to review.
